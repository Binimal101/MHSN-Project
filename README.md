# MHSN-Project
A local host display to show important newsflashes and graphics for MHSN
![alt text](https://github.com/Flaccite/MHSN-Project/blob/master/INFO/README-IMG/ExampleScreen.png?raw=true)

Requirements: 
```
- python == 3.8
- requests == 2.25.1
- lxml == 4.6.3
- beautifulsoup4 == 4.9.3
- flask == 2.0.1
- npm(optional) == 0.1.1
```

The way this works is by running the program on an operating system with a python interpreter and the required dependencies, the program will run a localhost with these elements. The way to export to a display is simply to run fullscreen on the localhost with the program running in the background.
