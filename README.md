#MHSN-Project
made by Matthew Tujague:

A local host display to show important newsflashes and graphics for MHSN

Requirements: 
```
- python == 3.8
- lxml == 4.6.3
- beautifulsoup4 == 4.9.3
- flask == 2.0.1
```

The way this works is by running the program on an operating system with a python interpreter and the required dependencies, 
the program will run a localhost with these elements. 
The way to export to a display is simply to run fullscreen on the localhost with the program running in the background.
