Cards not displaying images

Not able to remove horizontal line with id="adSeparator", able to to with jinja if, but no way so far to get rid of and reimpliment when needed

Glitches (Non Urgent):
  - Current glitch in which when resized, extra horizontal space is only allotted to the bottom of top card
  - Current glitch in which when switching texts, the horizontal and vertical alloted space of the cards increase/decrease
