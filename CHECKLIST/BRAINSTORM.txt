NEW IDEAS:

- GPS system for around the school
	- augmented reality pathfinding
		:CON
			- All too much learning to do.
	- google maps esque pathfinding
		:TODO
			- Check google maps or general GPS accuracy to see validity of plan
				
				- Store each and every single classes location to a dictionairy, along with hallway measurements etc
					- Check to see if the people in engineering classes took the measurements already

OLD IDEAS:

- Make html for display of information âœ…
	- Get a server to host the information as a website
		- Use dedicated school computers
			:CON
				- If power goes out the computer would need to manually be booted again
			
			:PRO
				- Would be nearly free

		- Use a replit pinging system
			:CON
				- Would not be up constantly
				- Display system would not know how or when to reload when repl is down without another system, meaning display would have some money involved
			
			:PRO
				- Would get information on when repl is up
				- Easy to modify code
				- Can have a custom domain (paid)
				- Free

		- Have a third party host the code
			:CON
				- Though third parties are quite reliable they aren't perfect, if something happens the display will have to be reset manually
				- Code will be more difficult to change and test
				- Not cost efficient in the long running

			:PRO
				- Computing power is no longer a worry
				- Most third parties have services that alert you when they go down along with other goodies
			
		

	- Use local hosts and raspi's
		- Have one decent raspi doing calculations and have it send weaker raspi's the information to display
		- Have a bunch of mediocre raspi's running localhosts
	


- Make html into an app
